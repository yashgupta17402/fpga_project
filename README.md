FPGA FINAL PROJECT :
Given:
a. Implementing VGA controller with help on how it works, and trying out monochrome colors on display

b. Use HLS to implement any filter (Gaussian blur, dithering, can let students choose). Exporting IP, testing output on ILA, checking for correctness. We can provide Python scripts to convert image to COE, verify ILA output

c. Integrate filtering IP with VGA monitor displaying; can introduce CDC (??) concept here
